Export posts from WordPress to CSV files

== Description ==
Export any post type to a CSV file.

The CSV file contains
- Basic post information
- Author's name
- Link to the featured image
- All post meta values
- All terms

To filter the results, go to the *Posts Table* page in the Dashboard and filter the results using WordPress's standard dropdowns. You'll export only the posts that would show in the table.


== Frequently Asked Questions ==

Just filter the posts that show in the Posts Table. The Export button will use the same filters.

Absolutely! You should be able to export any post type in the Dashboard.

Please note that WooCommerce products, WooCommerce orders, and post types that don't follow WordPress's standard conventions won't export all their data.
